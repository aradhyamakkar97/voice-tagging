<p id='0'><p>
<p id='1'>Where were you when I was burned and broken</p>
<p id='2'>While the days slipped by from my window watching</p>
<p id='3'>And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless<p>
<p id='4'>'Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me</p>

<p id='5'>While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words</p>
<p id='6'>Dying to believe in what you heard</p>
<p id='7'>I was staring straight into the shining sun</p>

<p id='8'>Lost in thought and lost in time</p>
<p id='9'>While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted</p>
<p id='10'>Outside the rain fell dark and slow</p>
<p id='11'>While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime</p>

<p id='12'>I took a heavenly ride through our silence</p>
<p id='13'>I knew the moment had arrived</p>
<p id='14'>For killing the past and coming back to life</p>

<p id='15'>I took a heavenly ride through our silence</p>
<p id='16'>I knew the waiting had begun</p>
<p id='17'>And headed straight ...into the shining sun</p>
